Hey Corey here,
Just opened this github to share code that I've been creating for fun. 
I am not a tech or coder by trade, I work an average job here in Canada but have a massive love for game modding.
Over the decades I've been able to learn programming on my own and get by making programs which focus on file editing and 3d model replacement.

So please be kind to me as I am still new to a lot of the coding terminologies and practices.
